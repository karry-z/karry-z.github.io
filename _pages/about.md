Hi there! 



My name is Karry. Or, you may prefer to address me by my Chinese name, 张恺睿. 



I am now a MSc student in University of Bristol. I am interested in Image Generation, Large Language Model and Reinforcement Learning. I believe that technology has the power to change the world for the better, and I want to be a part of that change.
